NAME
    Test::NoXS - Prevent a module from loading its XS code

VERSION
    version 1.03

SYNOPSIS
        use Test::NoXS 'Class::Load::XS';
        use Module::Implementation;

        eval "use Class::Load";
        is(
            Module::Implementation::implementation_for("Class::Load"),
            "PP",
            "Class::Load using PP"
        );

        # Disable all XS loading
        use Test::NoXS ':all';

        # Disable all XS loading except core or dual-life modules
        use Test::NoXS ':xs_core_or_dual';

        # Disable all XS loading except modules that shipped in core
        use Test::NoXS ':xs_core_only';

DESCRIPTION
    This modules hijacks DynaLoader and XSLoader to prevent them from
    loading XS code for designated modules. This is intended to help test
    how modules react to missing XS, e.g. by dying with a message or by
    falling back to a pure-Perl alternative.

USAGE
    Arguments on the use line control which XS modules are allowed. One and
    only one of the following options are allowed:

    *   ":all" — all XS loading is disabled

    *   ":xs_core_or_dual" — XS loading is disabled except for modules that
        are core modules in the current perl, even if they have been
        subsequently upgraded from CPAN

    *   ":xs_core_only" — XS loading is disabled except for modules that
        shipped with the current perl. Modules upgraded from CPAN will have
        XS disabled. This vaguely simulates upgrading dual-life modules on a
        system without a compiler.

    *   a list of module names — disables XS loading for these specific
        modules only
