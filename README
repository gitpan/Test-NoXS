NAME
    Test::NoXS - Prevent a module from loading its XS code

VERSION
    version 1.02

SYNOPSIS
        use Test::NoXS 'Class::Load::XS';
        use Module::Implementation;

        eval "use Class::Load";
        is(
            Module::Implementation::implementation_for("Class::Load"),
            "PP",
            "Class::Load using PP"
        );

        # Disable all XS loading
        use Test::NoXS ':all';

DESCRIPTION
    This modules hijacks DynaLoader and XSLoader to prevent them from
    loading XS code for designated modules. This is intended to help test
    how modules react to missing XS, e.g. by dying with a message or by
    falling back to a pure-Perl alternative.

USAGE
    Modules that should not load XS should be given as a list of arguments
    to "use Test::NoXS". Alternatively, giving ':all' as an argument will
    disable all future attempts to load XS.
